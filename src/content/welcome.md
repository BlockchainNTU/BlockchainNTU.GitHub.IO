Dear Hackathon Participants,

Welcome to TheBlockchainSPIRIT (TBS) Hackathon to be held on 29-30 June in NTU Singapore. For more info you can see http://bit.ly/TBS-hackathon-info

In TBS Hackathon, you are free to choose any blockchain platform of your liking for your project development.

We will, however, provide hands-on training of three major blockchain platforms:
1. [NEM](http://nem.io)
2. [Hyperledger](https://www.hyperledger.org)
3. [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org)
 
On the event day you can attend workshops on all the above platforms and choose any one to work on. However, to get a head-start before the hackathon, you can read some preliminary info about these platforms and do some initial platform-specific installations, as detailed below.
 
In case you have no prior experience with Blockchain or these platforms, you can skip these steps and join us directly at the hackathon. Our experts will guide you in the workshop and help you develop your first Blockchain project!
